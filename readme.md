# Python Code Sniffer üîç

A modular and extensible static analysis tool for Python code that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to enforce coding standards and best practices.


## Tools & Technologies üß∞
- python 

## Features ‚ú®

- **AST-based analysis**: Deep inspection of Python code structure  
- **Modular design**: Easily add new checkers for different code patterns  
- **Configurable rules**: Customize thresholds and requirements via JSON config  
- **Clear violation reporting**: Detailed output with line numbers and explanations  
- **Extensible violation system**: Create custom violation types for your specific needs  


## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-code-sniffer.git
cd python-code-sniffer
```

## Usage üöÄ

Run the sniffer on a Python file:

```bash
python main.py --file path/to/your/file.py
```
### Sample Output
```bash
3 violation(s)
-- ArgsCountViolation: 'test' at line 1 has more than 2 arguments: 3
-- NoDocstringViolation: 'test' has no docstring
-- NoDocstringViolation: 'Person' has no docstring
```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

You can customize the sniffer's behavior by modifying `rules` in `config.json`. This allows you to set thresholds and toggle specific checks.

### Example `config.json`:

```json
{
    "max_function_length": 4,
    "max_function_args_count": 2,
    "ensure_function_docstring": true
}
```

## Extending the Sniffer üõ†Ô∏è

The sniffer is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing you to easily add new checkers and violations to fit your specific coding standards.

### üîß Extending Existing Checkers

Sometimes, instead of creating a new checker from scratch, it‚Äôs more practical to **extend an existing checker**‚Äîfor example, to add new rules for functions or classes.

Below is an example of the `FunctionChecker`, which already includes checks for:

- Function length  
- Number of arguments  
- Presence of a docstring  

To **add a new check** to this existing checker:

#### 1. Define a New Check Method

Write a method inside the checker class (e.g., `FunctionChecker`).  
It should accept a single parameter `node` (an instance of `ast.FunctionDef`) and perform your analysis.

```python
def check_function_name_length(self, node):
    min_name_length = self.rules.get("min_function_name_length", 3)
    if node.name < min_name_length:
        # Create and append a violation
        violation = FunctionNameLengthViolation(node, name=node.name)
        self.violations.append(violation)
```

`FunctionNameLengthViolation` might look like this
```python 
from .violation import Violation

class FunctionNameLengthViolation(Violation):
    def __init__(self, node, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(node)
        self.max_function_len = kwargs.get("min_function_name_len")

    def show(self):
        length = self.node.end_lineno - self.node.lineno
        return f"'{self.node.name}' at line {self.node.lineno} has less than {self.min_function_name_len} characters in its name: {len(self.node.name)}"
```

#### 2. Call the Check Method in `visit_FunctionDef`
```python 
def visit_FunctionDef(self, node):
    # call existing methods
    # Call your new method here
    self.check_function_name_snake_case(node)

    self.generic_visit(node)
```
Remember to add a value for `min_function_name_length` and any other rule used in your check method to `rules` in `config.py`    

### üß© Creating New Checkers

To add a new checker:
### 1. Create a checker class
- In the `checkers/` directory, create a checker class that inherits from the base `Checker` class.
- Implement your analysis logic in appropriate methods.
- Your class should typically Include a `visit_classname` method where `classname` is the name of a node in the ast library e.g `visit_If` for the `ast.If` node.
- in the `violations/` directory, create any violation classes needed by your checker 

```python
# checkers/if_checker.py
from .checker import Checker

class IfChecker(Checker):
    def check_if_statement(self, node):
        # Your if statement check logic here
        pass

    def visit_If(self, node):
        self.check_if_statement(node)
        self.generic_visit(node)
```

### 2. Register Your Checker

After creating a new checker class, you need to **register it** so the sniffer knows to run it.
This is done by adding it to the `registered_checkers` list found in a central  `config.py`

### 3. Rules
If your checker relies on configurable parameters (e.g., line length limits, naming conventions), add those to `rules` in `config.py`. This makes them easy to tweak later without modifying code.

---

## Performance Considerations ‚öôÔ∏è
Currently, each registered checker operates on the entire AST and may **traverse the tree independently** when executed. This can lead to **multiple full tree traversals** ‚Äî one for each checker ‚Äî which can be improved on.
